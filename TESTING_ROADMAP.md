- ⚠️ **Missing Features**: User authentication, order persistence, payments

---

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Immediate Testing Priorities**

### **1. Critical Component Testing (Week 1)**

```bash
# Priority Order:
1. PriceDisplay ✅ (Fixed)
2. Cart Component (Order management)
3. RamenBuilder (Core functionality)
4. Menu/MenuClient (Product display)
5. Navigation Components
```

### **2. Integration Testing (Week 2)**

- API route testing (quotes, menu data)
- Database operations (if any)
- State management testing
- Form submission flows

### **3. E2E User Journeys (Week 3)**

- Complete ramen building flow
- Cart checkout process
- Theme switching
- Mobile responsiveness

## 🎯 **Testing Strategy by Component**

### **🛒 Cart Component**

**Current Issues Found:**

- CSS module import failures
- Complex price calculation logic
- Multi-step delivery options

**Testing Needs:**

- [ ] Price calculation accuracy
- [ ] Delivery option switching
- [ ] Item addition/removal
- [ ] Empty state handling
- [ ] Form validation

### **🍜 RamenBuilder Component**

**Current Issues Found:**

- Framer Motion integration
- Multi-step state management
- Complex selection logic

**Testing Needs:**

- [ ] Step navigation
- [ ] Selection persistence
- [ ] Price updates
- [ ] Validation rules
- [ ] Accessibility compliance

### **🎨 Theme System**

**Current Status:** Working
**Testing Needs:**

- [ ] Theme persistence
- [ ] CSS variable updates
- [ ] System preference detection

---

## 📈 **Coverage Goals & Metrics**

### **Current Baseline:**

- **Unit Tests**: 20 tests passing ✅
- **Component Tests**: 11 failing (fixable) ⚠️
- **Integration Tests**: Not yet run
- **E2E Tests**: Framework ready

### **Target Coverage:**

```
Component Tests:    80% coverage
Unit Tests:         90% coverage
Integration Tests:  70% coverage
E2E Critical Paths: 100% coverage
```

---

## 🔧 **Next Steps & Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions (Next 2 weeks):**

1. **Fix Component Test Failures**

   - Resolve CSS module imports
   - Fix framer-motion mocks
   - Update prop interfaces

2. **Establish Working Test Suite**

   - Get all component tests passing
   - Set up coverage reporting
   - Integrate with CI/CD

3. **Feature Gap Analysis**
   - Missing: User accounts, order history
   - Missing: Payment processing
   - Missing: Admin interface

### **TDD Development Process:**

```
1. Write failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Add integration tests
5. Add E2E coverage for critical paths
```

## 🏗️ **Recommended Architecture Improvements**

### **State Management:**

- Consider React Context for cart state
- Implement proper form validation
- Add error boundaries

### **Performance:**

- Add React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Add image optimization

### **Accessibility:**

- Add ARIA roles and labels
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers

---

## 📋 **Implementation Checklist**

### **Week 1: Stabilize Core Tests**

- [ ] Fix all component test failures
- [ ] Establish coverage baseline
- [ ] Set up test reporting

### **Week 2: Feature Testing**

- [ ] Test cart functionality completely
- [ ] Test ramen builder flow
- [ ] Add integration tests

### **Week 3: User Journey Testing**

- [ ] End-to-end test scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing

### **Week 4: Production Readiness**

- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Monitoring setup

## 💡 **Testing Best Practices Applied**

1. **Test Pyramid**: More unit tests, fewer E2E tests
2. **BDD Approach**: User story driven test scenarios
3. **Mock Strategy**: Mock external dependencies, test real logic
4. **Coverage Goals**: Quality over quantity metrics
5. **CI Integration**: Automated testing on every PR
