# Spaghetti Codes - Web Learning Tool

[Live Demo](https://spaghettis.netlify.app/)

Spaghetti Codes is a web-based learning tool built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)** and **Tailwind CSS**. It leverages **Netlify Core Primitives** like **Edge Functions**, **Image CDN**, and **Blob Store** for enhanced performance and functionality.

The app utilizes **implicit usage** of Netlify features (e.g., route handlers, image optimization with `next/image`) and offers **explicit usage** for more advanced features beyond Next.js.
